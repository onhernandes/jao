Just another relational database mapper for JavaScript

This was supposed to be Just Another Object Relational Mapping but I won't do OOP here.

This IS NOT for production, it's just for practicing my studies over ORMs, ODMs, design patterns for database and etc.

## PROJECT ARCHIVED

I won't be developing it anymore, since its just for my studies.
